# Docs AGENTS

## Style

- Use clear Markdown headings and concise paragraphs.
- Keep summaries factual and scoped to source material.
- If required source text is missing, add a banner: `SOURCE NEEDED: paste spec text here`.
- Prefer lists for requirements, decisions, and open questions.
- Link to related docs using relative paths.

## Content Guardrails

- Do not invent requirements, API details, or implementation specifics.
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and assumptions.
- Keep placeholders explicit and easy to replace.
