# Self-Improvement Loop

## Cadence

- Review progress weekly and after major milestones.
- Capture actionable follow-ups within 24 hours of a notable issue.
- Revisit the backlog and task definitions at least once per sprint.

## Logging Failures

- Record failures or regressions in `docs/agent/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with dates.
- Include a short summary, root cause (if known), and the corrective action.
- Tag entries with the affected area (e.g., docs, tooling, process).

## Keeping Memory in Docs

- Store decisions in ADRs and link them from relevant tasks.
- Keep open questions and assumptions in the task files until resolved.
- Use `docs/agent/STATUS.md` to track current focus and next steps.
